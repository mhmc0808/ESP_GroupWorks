-We should make Ex3 func more efficient by indexing the susceptibles and doing calculations only using them.
-We need to check that u should be randomly initialised both for the start of each day and also for each infected person.
-If we keep both u, rename them so tell them apart
-How efficient should Q2 be? And ask about the double loop again.
-Do our plots look pretty :)?
